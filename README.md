# Transfer-Learning-on-a-Custom-Self-Created-Dataset
Here I have implemented Transfer Learning on the Dataset that I had self-created on my own through Image Web-scrapping. 

The model used for training was ResNet-50. The highest accuracy achieved was around 80%. As the dataset was made through Image-Scrapping, it had also contained some of the wrong images.
